Few thing I really enjoy:

* Reading
* Food (I obviously **love** mexican food but, I also **like** sushi and noodles ðŸ¤¤)
* Learning new things. Recently I found out that I enjoy reading Philosophy.
* Although I am not a sports guy I do enjoy swiming and bodycombat

Fun fact: I started coding in C# back in 2010 and then (~2015) I changed .Net for Scala. #NoRegrets
